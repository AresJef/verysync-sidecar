# Creation defaults and configuration application

`folder_defaults()` and `device_defaults()` read the engine's current creation
templates. `update_folder_defaults()` and `update_device_defaults()` PATCH only
explicit fields. A change affects subsequent registrations through
`create_folder()` or `create_device()`; existing objects keep their settings.
Templates retain additional upstream fields, which can contain sharing secrets.
Their Debug implementations omit those values. A template's empty identity/path
is not a registered folder or device identity.

```no_run
use verysync_sidecar::{Client, DeviceCompression, DevicePatch, FolderDefaultsPatch};

async fn configure_future_registrations(client: &Client) -> verysync_sidecar::Result<()> {
    let update = client.update_folder_defaults(
        &FolderDefaultsPatch::default()
            .paused(true)
            .rescan_interval_seconds(300)
            .watcher_enabled(false),
    ).await?;
    if !update.requested_fields_match {
        // Readback differed: reconcile with the actual template before continuing.
        return Ok(());
    }
    client.update_device_defaults(
        &DevicePatch::default().compression(DeviceCompression::Never),
    ).await?;
    let application = client.configuration_sync_state().await?;
    // Inspect application.config_in_sync; choose an explicit restart if required.
    Ok(())
}
```

An empty patch is rejected before any request. Client clones serialize writes
and recheck authenticated identity; independent writers must coordinate. A
successful acknowledgment and matching readback establish configuration only.
`configuration_sync_state()` reports the native `configInSync` flag, independently
of matching requested values. It does not flush to disk, certify durability,
restart the engine, or prove scanning/transfer effects. The native integration
test separately checks new-object inheritance, existing-object isolation and
persistence across normal owned-instance shutdown/restart.

Writes are never retried. After cancellation or `MutationOutcomeUnknown`, read
the relevant template and reconcile before deciding whether to write again.
The library does not roll back configuration or implicitly restart an instance.
These methods do not change management credentials, start an official account
session, or acquire a commercial entitlement.

## Complete configuration saves

`configuration()` returns an identity-bound `ConfigurationSnapshot`, retaining
every native section and unknown field. `native_document()` exposes those values
only through explicit inspection; they include API keys and other private data.
Typed folder reads use the target's path syntax, including Windows paths when
the controller runs on another system. The snapshot can edit general options and
creation defaults without reconstructing or dropping unrelated configuration.
Other typed controls continue to manage their own sections through scoped APIs.

```no_run
use verysync_sidecar::{Client, Error, GeneralOptionsPatch};

async fn save_reviewed_configuration(client: &Client) -> verysync_sidecar::Result<()> {
    let mut snapshot = client.configuration().await?;
    snapshot.set_general_options(
        &GeneralOptionsPatch::default().keep_temporaries_hours(48),
    )?;
    match client.replace_configuration(&snapshot).await {
        Ok(receipt) => {
            // Inspect receipt.requested_fields_match and
            // receipt.application_state.config_in_sync independently.
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(Error::ConfigurationChanged) => {
            // Read a fresh snapshot, review the concurrent change, and decide
            // what to save. Never automatically replay the stale document.
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(error) => Err(error),
    }
}
```

Immediately before PUT, the current complete document must equal the original
snapshot. A known stale snapshot returns `ConfigurationChanged` without a write;
a snapshot from another identity is rejected before any request. This check is
not an atomic server-side compare-and-swap. Independent writers must coordinate
throughout the operation, including the interval between the last read and PUT.
The library does not promise atomicity, rollback or protection from an external
writer that changes configuration in that interval.

The receipt reports exact full-document equality and the native application flag
separately. A malformed or failed readback after acknowledgment returns
`MutationOutcomeUnknown`, without retry. Normal shutdown/restart persistence and
retained file bytes are checked independently by native integration tests.

`general_options()` and `update_general_options()` also provide scoped read/PATCH
operations for temporary-file retention, signed progress intervals, folder/dial/
request concurrency, process-priority policy, sleep-prevention policy, minimum
configuration-volume free space, temporary index blocks, remote-name adoption,
full-index resend after upgrade and IP traffic class. `-1` explicitly requests
disabled native progress reporting. Numeric zero values retain the engine's
interpretation. Optional additional readback fields remain `None` when absent;
missing values are not invented as zero or false.

```no_run
use verysync_sidecar::{Client, DiskFreeRequirement, DiskSpaceUnit, GeneralOptionsPatch};

async fn select_general_preferences(client: &Client) -> verysync_sidecar::Result<()> {
    let threshold = DiskFreeRequirement::new(256.0, DiskSpaceUnit::Megabytes)?;
    let update = client.update_general_options(
        &GeneralOptionsPatch::default()
            .min_home_disk_free(threshold)
            .progress_update_interval_seconds(-1),
    ).await?;
    // Inspect requested_fields_match; application and persistence are separate.
    Ok(())
}
```

`DiskFreeRequirement` preserves native `%`, `kB`, `MB`, `GB` and `TB` selectors;
byte units are decimal. Values must be finite and nonnegative, and percentages
cannot exceed 100. Unknown readback units are retained and rejected by typed
edits, including complete-snapshot edits. The SDK neither measures the controller
disk nor reserves space. The native configuration/index volume is the target.

The controlled case checks all five unit selectors, fractional values, partial
field preservation, disabled progress selection and normal restart persistence.
It independently observes the owned process/group's OS priority before and after
an explicit low-priority policy change and restart. This does not certify actual
temporary expiry, concurrency limits, disk-pressure handling, sleep prevention,
remote-name replacement, packet QoS or a performance improvement. Network,
bandwidth, upgrade and audit settings retain their separate typed APIs and
verification boundaries. Full same-source platform acceptance remains separate.
